            <h4>Invasive trolls species have quickly become a problem in the greater Seattle area. Every day, peaceful mythic species are losing precious territory to the invasive and aggresive troll species of the northwest. In the last year, Pixies, Fairies, and Gnomes have been added to the critically endangered list due to troll hunting and territory invasion.
